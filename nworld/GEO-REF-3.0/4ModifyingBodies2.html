<h3> Make Displacement</h3>
</a><a name="6174">
<em>Polyhedra, wires</em><p>
</a><P><a name="6175">
Saves and names displacements. <p>
</a><P><a name="6177">
Operations in the <strong>Displacements</strong> section of the GeoMenu let you create, modify, and save displacements for polygons. A <em>displacement</em> is a named, saved state of a polyhedron's vertices or a wire's nodes. What does that mean? <p>
</a><P><a name="6178">
Imagine you were doing a traditional animation with clay models; for each frame, you'd have to repose the skeleton, then shoot a frame. If a character turned his head to the left, you'd have to turn the head slightly for each frame, and shoot it in each new position.<p>
</a><P><a name="6179">
Now imagine that instead of a clay character, you are using a wireframe model in N-Geometry. Using our displacement operations, you could save a pose of the model looking straight ahead as an <em>absolute</em> displacement, rotate the head using one of the rotate commands, then save a pose of the model looking left as a <em>relative</em> displacement.<p>
</a><P><a name="6180">
Each of these displacements can be named and animated from the N-Dynamics animation choreographer as keyframe poses in a script. You might specify that the model start in its original position at frame 1, and that it end looking left (using the relative displacement) in frame 30. When you animated the script, the frames between would be generated <em>automatically</em>, and the model would turn its head to the left.<p>
</a><P><dl>
<dt><dd><font color=dd000><strong>Note.</strong>	<em>You can't add or subtract the number of points on a polygon if you want its displacements to remain valid. This means that operations such as </em><strong>Scale</strong><em>, </em><strong>Twist</strong><em>, and </em><strong>Rotate</strong><em> are valid to create relative displacements, but </em><strong>Collapse</strong><em> and </em><strong>Dissolve</strong><em> are not. For this reason, you should make any changes to your model before making any displacements.</em></font></dd></dt></dl><P>
<a name="6182">
Absolute displacements save information for all vertices on the object; relative displacements save information only for those vertices that have been moved.<p>
</a><P><a name="6183">
There are two types of relative displacements:<p>
</a><P><ul><a name="6184">
<li>Linear
</a></li><P><a name="6185">
<li>Rotational
</a></li><P></ul><P><a name="6186">

</em></a><P><a name="6238">
Each of the other options in the Select Displacement Parameters is described below.<p>
</a><P><ul><a name="6239">
<li><strong>Saving Mode</strong> specifies what kind of displacement is saved:
</a></li><P><ul>
<BR><a name="6240">
<li><strong>Absolute</strong> saves the current state of the polyhedron or wire. The save consists of a list of the absolute locations of all the polyhedron's vertices or wire's winged segments.
</a><P><BR><a name="6241">
<li><strong>Relative</strong> saves an incremental <em>linear</em> displacement. This is a list of the differences between the current state and another state. Only those vertices or winged segments that are actually different are saved. The menu changes so you can specify whether the displacements are made from a previous absolute state of the same polyhedron or wire, or if they are made from the current state of another polyhedron or wire.
</a><P><BR><a name="6242">
<li><strong>Rel Rotation</strong> saves an incremental <em>rotational</em> displacement. Rotational developments were developed because of the shearing effect that can occur when you move part of a model, such as an arm or a leg. See the section <a href="4ModifyingBodies2.html#6255">"Linear vs. rotational displacements," on page &#32;4-54</a> for a description of both kinds of displacements and when to use each.
</a><P></ul>
<a name="6246">
<li><strong>Source </strong>specifies the "from" state for the displacement-the state the relative displacement is calculated from.
</a></li><P><ul>
<BR><a name="6247">
<li><strong>Previous State</strong> specifies that the displacement is a variation of the same polyhedron or wire.
</a><P><BR><a name="6248">
<li><strong>From polyhedron</strong> specifies the object from which a displacement is performed. The polyhedron must have the same topology (typically a copy of the same object in a different pose).
</a><P><BR><a name="6249">
<li><strong>To polyhedron</strong> displaces the object toward a polyhedron with the same topology (again, typically a copy of the object). This can be used to displace the object "to" the state of the "to polyhedron".
</a><P><BR><a name="6250">
<li><strong>Other Polyhedron</strong> can be used to generate a relative displacement from an object not necessarily the original, but topologically identical to it (same number of vertices connected in the same way). For example, if you had created a displacement for a cube, you could base its relative displacement from any other cube, but not a cylinder, which has a different number of points connected in a different way.
</a><P><dl><a name="6251">
<dt>You could, however, generate a displacement from a copy of the object you might have saved earlier (as long as the two objects had identical topologies).<p>
</a><P></dl></ul>
<a name="6252">
<li><strong>State</strong> specifies the state from which the new displacement has been derived.
</a></li><P></ul><P><a name="6255">
<h4> Linear vs. rotational displacements</h4>
</a><a name="6256">
When should you use rotational rather than linear displacements? In a linear displacement, points move from their base position to their target position along a linear path. While this type of animation is easy to calculate, it can cause shearing effects:<p>
</a><P><a name="6266">
 <P><img src="4ModifyingBodies.anc74.gif"><p>
</a><a name="6267">
<em>Figure 4.76  &#32; &#32;When using a linear displacement, points follow a straight path to their target state, which can cause shearing or distortion
</em></a><P><a name="6268">
Linear displacements make sense if you're performing operations on an object that wouldn't cause points to be moved through other points (such as scaling or moving).<p>
</a><P><a name="6269">
In a rotational displacement, points move rotationally around a selected axis:<p>
</a><P><a name="6279">
 <P><img src="4ModifyingBodies.anc75.gif"><p>
</a><a name="6281">
<em>Figure 4.77  &#32; &#32;Left, displacing using a rotational displacement lets you select an axis which the displaced vertices rotate around
</em></a><P><a name="6282">
Choose rotational displacements if the operation you want the displacement to follow a curved rather than straight path. You specify the rotation axis that the displaced points are to rotate around when defining the relative rotational displacement (notice the addition of the <strong>Axis</strong> menu item):<p>

</a><P><a name="6290">

<h3> Make Frozen Mapper</h3>
</a><a name="11187">
<em>Any body</em><p>
</a><P><a name="11188">
Fixes the relationship of the specified mapper to the surface of the object. To do this, you need to capture the mapper and the position of the vertices at a certain point in time and save those positions for reference during rendering. <p>
</a><P><a name="11189">
This is called "applying a dynamic mapper" and produces a <em>frozen</em> mapper. The resulting frozen mapper is a <em>copy</em> of the dynamic mapper, saved with the positions of the object's vertices and the mapper's transformation at the time it was created.<p>
</a><P><a name="11190">
You typically apply a mapper to an object that <em>changes shape</em> (deforms) over the course of an animation.<p>
</a><P><a name="11191">
When you animate an object with a frozen mapper, the map image <em>always</em> remains in the same position on the surface of the object. Because a frozen mapper represents a fixed mapping relationship, no visible mapper object exists for frozen mappers, nor can their transformations be animated.<p>
</a><P><a name="11192">
Creating and applying mappers is discussed in detail in the <em>N-Geometry Tutorial</em>.<p>
</a><P><a name="11194">
<h3> Make Part Frozen Mapper</h3>
</a><a name="11195">
<em>Faces, bodies</em><p>
</a><P><a name="11196">
Applies a mapper created in N-Geometry to a selected face part.<p>
</a><P><a name="11197">
The creation and application of mappers is discussed in detail in the <em>N-Geometry Tutorial</em>.<p>
</a><P><a name="6878">
<h3> Make Patch Body</h3>
</a><a name="6879">
<em>Polyhedron</em><p>
</a><P><a name="6880">
Makes a patch-body for the currently selected object. A patch body has the same number of vertices, edges, and faces as the original object; however, all edges are smoothed in the "patched" copy. The effect is particularly visible if you turn shading on for the patch body object. Some renderers <em>require</em> patch bodies for rendering purposes.<p>
</a><P><a name="6881">
To create a patch body:<p>
</a><P>
<a name="6882">
<STRONG>	 1.	 Create an object.

</a><P><a name="6883">
<STRONG>	2.	 <strong>(SHIFT-L)</strong> on the object.

To change the shape of the patchified body, change the shape of the original polygon body; in <a href="4ModifyingBodies2.html#6891">Figure 4.80</a>, we moved a point on the original, or "control" icosahedron to deform the patch body.<p>

<h3> Make Spline</h3>
</a><a name="6801">
<em>Wires</em><p>
</a><P><a name="6802">
Creates a splined wire from a control wire. The splined wire is actually a regular wire whose nodes lie on a b-spline curve that uses the control wire's nodes as control points.<p>

If you intend to render an object and you know how you want the object to look, you can use Cut to divide the object into triangles. If you do not cut faces, most renderers triangularize non-planar faces automatically, which might cause the object to be rendered in a manner you did not intend.</em></font></dd></dt><a name="6119">

</a><a name="7964">
<em>Faces, collections of faces</em><p>
</a><P><a name="7965">
<strong>Multiple Extrude</strong> lets you perform multiple operations on a face or collection of faces at one time. In addition to the basic extrusion of a face, you can move, scale, rotate, twist, and circularize the face as it is extruded from the original body. In addition, the extrusion can be given a "domed" appearance. This feature is great for pulling out horns, antennae, claws, etc. on creatures, or any non-uniform extrusion from a body.<p>
